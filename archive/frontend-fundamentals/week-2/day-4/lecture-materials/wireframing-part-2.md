# Wireframing Part 2

<br>
<br>

**During the last morning exercise, we built out the HTML for the VSSL mockup:**

**This morning, we're going to work on styling it with CSS to make it look more like the mockup.**



<br>

<br>


## Setup

1. You already created the HTML for this mockup last morning exercise, so for part 2 we'll keep working on that same project
2. Inside that vssl_mockup folder, create a `style.css` file. Make sure it's on the same level as your `index.html` file as well as the `img` folder and `mockup.png` file.
3. Inside your `index.html` file, link your `style.css`
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.
   - You can check that your CSS is attached correctly by adding a background color to the page temporarily.

## Activity

1. Your focus should be on positioning the content!
1. Save looking for fonts for last. You don't need the exact font - just choose something that looks similar.
