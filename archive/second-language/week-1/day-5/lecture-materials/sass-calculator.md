# Sass Calculator


You've already built a calculator with CSS, now it's time to build one with SASS!
For this morning exercise, we want you to focus on the styling, so we've provided starter-code for you. However, you've already built the HTML structure for a calculator. So you have two options:

1. If you use the starter-code, `cd` into the starter-code directory, examine your code and wireframe (included), then follow the directions below and use SASS to style your calculator like the mockup image (included) or create your own styling! There is also a css file included which corresponds to the mockup image. Feel free to refrerence this code if you like, but be sure to translate it into best practices SCSS (ex: use nesting and stuff!)

2. If you'd rather use your own HTML structure from week 3 day 2, feel free to do so! Copy and paste the html file or code into your morning exercise directory for today and then follow the instructions below. (Remember to disconnect your .css file for best practices - No unused code!)

## Set up

**In a `morning_exercise` folder (or the <a href="/downloads/second_language/sass-calculator/starter-code.zip" download>starter-code</a> folder)**
- `mkdir css`
- `touch css/main.scss`
- start a new tab
  - `sass --watch css/main.scss css/main.css`
  - some new files should generate, including `main.css` (inside your css folder)
- add some html boilerplate to your `index.html`
- link your `main.css` file to your `index.html`
- code inside `main.scss` - every time you save your changes in `main.scss` the `sass --watch` tab will watch for changes and compile your Sass to CSS.

- Do not worry about functionality. Just focus on making it look awesome.
