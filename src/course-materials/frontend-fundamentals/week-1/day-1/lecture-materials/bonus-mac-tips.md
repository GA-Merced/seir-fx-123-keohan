### Launching Apps with Spotlight
- Developers avoid using the mouse whenever possible

- Developers are more productive when their hands are on the keyboard

- Open applications using _Spotlight_ instead of the mouse by:
	1. Pressing `cmd+space` to open _Spotlight_
	2. Start typing the name of the app until the app is highlighted
	3. Press `enter` to open the app!

<br>
<br>

### Switching Between Applications
- Quickly switch between running applications by pressing `cmd+tab`

- If a minimized applications does not display after tabbing to it with `cmd+tab`:
	1. Continue to hold down `cmd` and release `tab`
	2. Press `option` then release `cmd`


<br>
<br>

### Switching Between Instances of an Application

- You can switch between multiple windows of the same application using **cmd+\`** (that's a back-tick character, which is above the `tab` key)

- Note that it's best to minimize how many windows/applications you have open when developing to make switching between applications quicker and minimize distractions to the job at hand

## Uploading Screenshots and Images to _imgur.com_

<br>



### Why Upload Images?
- Often you will need to share images with others or use them in your applications, notes, readme files, etc

- Unfortunately, if an image exists only on your computer, you lose the ability to use it anywhere but on your computer

- The solution is to upload images to a cloud service...


<br>
<br>

### Imgur

- One of the most popular image hosting services on the Internet is [Imgur](http://imgur.com/).

- Go there now and open a free account

- Although you can upload images using Imgur's web interface, but there's a better way...

<br>
<br>

### mac2imgur
- [mac2imgur](https://github.com/mileswd/mac2imgur) is a simple Mac app that makes uploading images and screenshots to your Imgur account a snap

- Go to the link above and download/install it

- After installed, launch it, click the <img src="https://i.imgur.com/K3RFxZj.png" /> in your menubar, then select `Imgur/Sign-in`.  Note that if you don't sign in, your uploaded images will be uploaded to Imgur's public domain

- You can now upload images from your computer by clicking the _mac2imgur_ icon in the menubar and selecting `Upload images...`

- Screenshots can also now be automatically uploaded to Imgur...


<br>
<br>

### Screenshots
- The following keyboard shortcuts can be used to take screenshots of your screen:
	- Whole screen: `shift-cmd-3`
	- Part of your screen: `shift-cmd-4`
	- A certain window: `shift-cmd-4`, then `spacebar` to toggle window mode

## Using _Spectacle_ to<br>Move and Size Windows
<br>



### What is _Spectacle_?

- _Spectacle_ is a free utility that resizes and snaps into position app windows

- If you don't see the "spectacles" in your menubar, launch _Spectacle_ using _Spotlight_

- When running, _Spectacle_ will listen to the keyboard for certain key combinations (hotkeys) and will resize/position the active application accordingly...


<br>
<br>

### _Spectacle_'s Basic Default Hotkeys

- Here are the most popular hotkeys:

	- Make window full-size — `opt + cmd + F`
	- Move to the left half — `opt + cmd + ←`
	- Move to the right half — `opt + cmd + →`
	- Move to the top half — `opt + cmd + ↑`
	- Move to the bottom half — `opt + cmd + ↓`

- Pressing the same hotkey will size the window by thirds!
