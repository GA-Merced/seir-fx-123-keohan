#### How To:

##### Communicate in one of the ringo channels:

	- @username
		- sends a notification to a specific user
	- @channel / @here
		- sends a notification to everyone / everyone currently online
    - DO NOT use these unless absolutely necessary (usually only instructors/TAs use this)

<br>
<br>

##### Communicate privately:

- Direct messages are one-on-one messages nobody else can see
- In addition, you can make group direct messages to talk to multiple people at once, privately

<br>
<br>

##### Other:

	- You can mute channels that you no longer need (e.g. Fundamentals)
	- You can adjust the sound / notifications of your messages

<br>
